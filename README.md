# blink
Downloading multiple videos from the Blink app can be tedious and time consuming, especially when dealing with hundreds or thousands of clips. The app requires users to manually download videos one at a time, often requiring hours of repetitive scrolling.

This script streamlines the process by leveraging blinkpy, a powerful Python library for interacting with the Blink Camera system. With this tool, you can efficiently bulk download videos from your Blink account, saving time and effort.
